# SQL-Exercise-CodeChef

This repository contains solutions to SQL problems from the **CodeChef SQL Exercise**. Each problem focuses on different SQL concepts such as `SELECT`, `AVG`, `DISTINCT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY`.

## Problem Statements

### 1. **All Products**  
   - Retrieve all products from the database, displaying relevant product details.  
   - This problem helps in understanding the basic `SELECT` statement.

### 2. **High Price of Products**  
   - Find and display products that have the highest price in the database.  
   - This problem focuses on using the `MAX()` function or ordering data with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.

### 3. **Average Salary**  
   - Calculate the average salary of employees in the database.  
   - This problem demonstrates the use of the `AVG()` function to find the mean value of a column.

### 4. **Locate Peoples**

   - This problem helps in understanding the use of the `WHERE` clause to filter records.

### 5. **Distinct Companies**

   - This problem emphasizes the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove duplicates in query results.
